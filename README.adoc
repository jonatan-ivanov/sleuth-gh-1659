== Sample App

This sample demonstrates https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/issues/1659

Run the application and use curl to send some data:

- `$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/foo/bar`
- `$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/foo/fail`

On the happy path, you should see that the service received the data from Kafka and also the tracing information (`[demo-app,dea43b6ce822e2ff,aa28106d91799038]`):

```
2020-12-22 16:45:38.575  INFO [demo-app,dea43b6ce822e2ff,aa28106d91799038] 2048 --- [ fooGroup-0-C-1] com.example.Application                  : Received: bar
```

On the not-so-happy path, you can see the same received message again with the tracing information as well as the error that does not contain the tracing information (`[demo-app,,]`):

```
